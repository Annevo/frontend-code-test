# Frontend code-test @ Annevo
For this assignment you'll create an app for listing Star Wars movies. The data should be fetched from the following endpoint: https://star-wars-api.herokuapp.com/films.

You are free to use which ever frontend framework you prefer as long as you're using JavaScript or TypeScript. You don't have to solve all of the tasks but we want you to be able to explain what you have done and why you have chosen to do it like that. 

## Description
When the app is loaded, a list of the movies should be displayed as the image below shows:
![Default view](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/709159/39311980-a0bc7b08-496e-11e8-8171-5f4c04cf1bd2.png)

There should be a way to order the movies by `Year` or `Episode` as the select menu shows in the image below:
![Sort by year of episode](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/709159/39311979-a09dd338-496e-11e8-9183-57ae82a511cb.png)

When clicking on a movie in the list, a detailed view of it should be displayed in the right hand side of the application. In this case, ”Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back” is chosen (when no movie is selected, a default text should be displayed instead):
![Episode V details](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/709159/39311976-a080c3f6-496e-11e8-88df-64642a3ef681.png)

Additionally, there should be a way to filter the movies by entering their name in the text input:
![Filter out specific movies](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/709159/39311975-a05fde48-496e-11e8-9078-8040572b02b5.png)

**The images above are just en example layout, but the final result should aim to have the same features, and a similar layout**.
